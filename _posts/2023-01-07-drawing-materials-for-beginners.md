## Pencils
Pencils are a staple of drawing and come in many different types and grades. Here are some important things to know about pencils:

### A. Types of Pencils
There are two main types of pencils that beginners should be familiar with: graphite and charcoal. Graphite pencils are made of a mixture of graphite and clay and come in varying degrees of hardness, while charcoal pencils are made of compressed charcoal and produce darker lines.

### B. Pencil Grades and their Uses
Pencil grades are indicated by a combination of letters and numbers, with "H" indicating hardness and "B" indicating darkness. The higher the number, the harder or darker the pencil. For example, a 2H pencil is harder than an HB pencil, while a 2B pencil is darker.

Beginners should start with a set of pencils that includes a range of grades, such as 2H, HB, 2B, 4B, and 6B. A harder pencil like 2H is ideal for sketching and outlining, while softer pencils like 4B and 6B are great for shading and adding depth to your drawings.

### C. Tips on Choosing the Right Pencil Set for Adult Beginners
When choosing a pencil set, consider your drawing style and subject matter. If you're interested in realistic portraits or detailed landscapes, a set with a wider range of pencil grades will be beneficial. If you're more interested in cartooning or graphic design, a set with a smaller range of grades may suffice.

Additionally, consider the size of the pencil set you purchase. A set with too many pencils can be overwhelming for beginners, while a set with too few may limit your options. A set with around 12 pencils of varying grades is a good place to start.

## 2. Colored Pencils

Colored pencils are a popular drawing tool among beginner and professional artists alike. Here are some important things to know about colored pencils:

### A. Types of Colored Pencils
There are three main types of colored pencils: oil-based, wax-based, and water-soluble. Oil-based colored pencils have a softer lead and are ideal for blending and layering. Wax-based colored pencils are harder and more resistant to breakage, making them a good choice for fine details. Water-soluble colored pencils can be blended with water, creating a watercolor-like effect.

### B. Benefits and Drawbacks of Each Type
Oil-based colored pencils produce vibrant colors and are easy to blend, but they can be difficult to erase and may smudge easily. Wax-based colored pencils are more durable and easier to erase, but their colors may not be as vibrant as oil-based pencils. Water-soluble colored pencils offer a unique blending technique and are easy to erase, but they can be less pigmented and require a special paper to avoid pilling.

### C. Tips on Choosing the Right Colored Pencils for Adult Beginners
When choosing colored pencils, consider your drawing style and preferences. If you enjoy blending and layering colors, oil-based colored pencils may be your best bet. If you prefer fine details and a harder lead, wax-based pencils may suit you better. If you want to experiment with watercolor techniques, water-soluble colored pencils are a great choice.

It's also important to consider the quality of the colored pencils you purchase. Higher quality colored pencils will have better pigmentation, which means more vibrant colors, and will also be easier to blend and layer. However, they may also be more expensive. For beginners, a set of around 24 colored pencils is a good place to start.


## 3. Pens

Pens are a versatile drawing tool that can produce a range of line widths and textures. Here's what beginners should know about using pens:

### A. Types of Pens
There are several types of pens commonly used in drawing, including ballpoint, felt-tip, brush, and gel pens. Ballpoint pens have a small, round tip and produce a consistent line width. Felt-tip pens have a wider, marker-like tip and can produce both thin and thick lines. Brush pens have a flexible tip that can create a variety of line widths, from thin to thick. Gel pens have a smooth, rollerball-like tip and produce a more fluid line.

### B. Benefits and Drawbacks of Each Type
Ballpoint pens are durable and can be used for a long time, but they may not produce a very expressive line. Felt-tip pens can produce a range of line widths and are great for sketching and outlining, but they may dry out quickly. Brush pens are great for creating a variety of textures and line widths, but they can be more difficult to control. Gel pens produce a smooth, consistent line, but they may not be as long-lasting as other types of pens.

### C. Tips on Choosing the Right Pens for Adult Beginners
When choosing pens, consider the type of lines and textures you want to create. If you want to create a range of line widths, a set of felt-tip pens or brush pens might be best. If you want a consistent, smooth line, gel pens may be a good choice. Additionally, consider the quality of the pens you purchase. Higher quality pens will produce better lines and be more durable.

### D. Tips on Using Pens Effectively in Your Drawing Practice
When using pens, it's important to experiment with different line weights and textures. Try using thicker lines for outlines and thinner lines for details. You can also experiment with cross-hatching and stippling techniques to create different textures. Practice using a light touch and building up your lines gradually. Finally, don't be afraid to make mistakes - pens can be more difficult to erase than pencils, but you can always incorporate mistakes into your artwork.



This post would cover the different types of drawing materials that beginners need to get started, including pencils, erasers, paper, and other supplies. It's important for beginners to understand what they need and how to choose the right materials so they can practice effectively.


## 4. Erasers
When it comes to drawing, erasers are just as important as pencils and paper. Different erasers are designed to erase different types of marks and can help you correct mistakes or add highlights to your drawings. Here are some of the most common types of erasers:

**A. Kneaded Eraser:** This eraser is made of pliable material and can be molded into any shape, making it perfect for erasing small details or hard-to-reach areas.
**B. Vinyl Eraser:** This eraser is a bit harder than a kneaded eraser and can be used to erase pencil marks cleanly without leaving smudges.
**C. Gum Eraser:** This eraser is softer than a vinyl eraser and can be used to remove graphite and charcoal from your paper.
**D. Rubber Eraser:** Rubber erasers are the most common type of eraser and can be used to erase pencil marks. They come in different shapes and sizes.
**E. Sand Eraser:** This eraser is made of fine abrasive material and is used to remove ink or colored pencil marks from paper.
**F. Eraser Pencil:** This eraser is designed like a pencil and can be sharpened to erase small details.
**G. Glass Eraser:** This eraser is made of glass and can be used to erase ink or other stubborn marks.

Each type of eraser has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. It's important to experiment with different types of erasers to find the ones that work best for your drawing style and technique.

### Tips on how to use erasers effectively in your drawing practice

- Use light pressure when erasing to avoid damaging the paper.
- Start with a softer eraser and work your way up to harder erasers if necessary.
- Use a kneaded eraser to pick up small details and highlights.
- Use an eraser shield or tape to protect areas of your drawing that you don't want to erase.
- Avoid using your fingers to smudge or blend eraser marks, as the oils from your skin can damage the paper over time.


## Paper
As a beginner, choosing the right type of paper for your drawing can be just as important as choosing the right drawing tools. There are a variety of papers available that can influence the final result of your drawing.

### A. Types of Paper
The two main types of paper used for drawing are sketch and drawing paper. Sketch paper is thinner and often used for quick sketches and preliminary drawings. Drawing paper is thicker and can handle more layers of drawing and erasing.

There are also different textures of paper available such as smooth, medium, and rough textures. Smooth paper is often used for detailed drawings, while rougher paper is ideal for creating texture and depth in your artwork.

### B. Paper Quality
The quality of paper you choose can greatly impact the final result of your drawing. Lower quality paper can easily tear or smudge, while higher quality paper can handle more layers of drawing and erasing without losing its texture or color.

When choosing paper, look for a weight of at least 80lb or higher for drawing paper and 50lb or higher for sketch paper. Acid-free paper is also a good option as it resists yellowing and fading over time.

### C. Tips for Choosing the Right Paper
Consider the subject matter and style of your drawing when choosing paper. If you prefer to work with watercolors or markers, then a heavier weight paper like watercolor paper may be more suitable. If you prefer a smoother surface for detailed drawings, then smooth paper is the way to go.

Ultimately, the best way to determine the right paper for your needs is to experiment with different types and textures. Start with a few sheets of different types of paper and see which one feels right for you and your drawing style.

## VI. Other Supplies
When it comes to drawing, there are many additional supplies that can be helpful for beginners to have on hand. Here are some examples:
**A. Blending stumps:** Blending stumps are cylindrical tools made of tightly rolled paper used to blend and smoothen areas of a drawing. They come in different sizes, and they are particularly useful when working with charcoal or graphite pencils.
**B. Ruler:** A ruler is a simple tool that can be very useful in drawing. It can be used to create straight lines, measure proportions, and ensure accuracy in your work. It's recommended to use a transparent ruler to avoid obstructing your view of the drawing.
**C. Other supplies:** There are many other supplies that can be helpful for your drawing practice such as fixatives, drawing boards, easels, sharpeners, etc. Each of these supplies has its own benefits and drawbacks, and the choice of what to get will depend on your personal preferences and budget.

Regardless of which supplies you choose, always keep in mind that they are tools to help you achieve your goals. Your skill and creativity are the most important factors in creating a successful drawing.

## Key Take Away
