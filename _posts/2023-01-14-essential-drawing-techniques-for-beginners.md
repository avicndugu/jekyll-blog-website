Value
Let's dive in and explore each one in more detail.


## 1 Contour Drawing

When you're first starting out with drawing, one of the most important techniques to learn is contour drawing. So, what is contour drawing? Simply put, it's the technique of drawing the outline of an object or figure, without shading or coloring it in.

Why is contour drawing essential for every beginner to learn? Well, it helps you to develop your hand-eye coordination, and to see the shapes and proportions of objects more accurately. With practice, contour drawing can help you to create more realistic and detailed drawings.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating a Contour Drawing**

1. Choose an object or subject to draw. It can be anything - a piece of fruit, a coffee mug, or even your own hand.
2. Begin by observing the object closely, and identify its basic shapes and forms. For example, if you're drawing a coffee mug, it might be a cylinder with a handle.
3. Using a pencil, lightly sketch the basic shapes and forms of the object. Don't worry about details at this point - focus on getting the overall shape and proportions right.
4. Once you have the basic shapes and forms sketched out, start to add more detail. Look closely at the object, and draw the contours of its edges and curves.
5. Continue to refine the drawing, adding more details and making adjustments as necessary.

### **Tips for Improving Accuracy and Line Quality**

- Use light, gentle pressure when sketching the basic shapes and forms. This will allow you to easily make adjustments as you go.
- Pay close attention to the angles and curves of the object you're drawing. Try to replicate them as accurately as possible.
- Take breaks and step back from your drawing frequently. This will help you to see any errors or inconsistencies more clearly.
- Practice, practice, practice! The more you draw, the better you'll become at contour drawing.


## 2. Shading

Shading is a technique used in drawing to create the illusion of depth and dimension in your artwork. It's an important skill to master, as it can help bring your drawings to life and make them look more realistic.

### **Importance of Shading**

Shading is essential because it helps to define the form of the object you're drawing. By using light and shadow, you can create the appearance of volume and depth, which makes your drawing more three-dimensional.

### **Shading Techniques**

There are several different shading techniques that you can use in your drawings, including:

- **Hatching:** This technique involves drawing parallel lines close together to create the appearance of shading. The closer together the lines, the darker the shading will be.
- **Cross-hatching:** Cross-hatching is similar to hatching, but involves drawing lines in two or more directions, creating a cross-hatch pattern.
- **Stippling:** Stippling involves creating shading by using dots or small marks, placed close together or far apart depending on how light or dark you want the shading to be.

### **Examples and Step-by-Step Instructions**

### Hatching

1. Choose an object or subject to draw.
2. Start by drawing the outlines of the object using a light pencil.
3. Decide on the direction of the light source, and imagine where the shadows would fall.
4. Using a pencil, draw lines in the direction of the shadow. The closer together the lines, the darker the shading will be.
5. Continue to layer lines on top of each other until you achieve the desired level of shading.

### Cross-Hatching

1. Choose an object or subject to draw.
2. Draw the outlines of the object using a light pencil.
3. Decide on the direction of the light source, and imagine where the shadows would fall.
4. Using a pencil, draw lines in one direction, creating a series of parallel lines.
5. Draw another set of lines in a different direction, crossing over the first set of lines.
6. Continue to add more lines, crossing over the previous set, until you achieve the desired level of shading.

### Stippling

1. Choose an object or subject to draw.
2. Draw the outlines of the object using a light pencil.
3. Decide on the direction of the light source, and imagine where the shadows would fall.
4. Using a pencil, create small dots or marks in the areas where the shadows would fall.
5. The closer together the dots, the darker the shading will be. Continue to add more dots until you achieve the desired level of shading.


## 3. Perspective

When it comes to drawing realistic scenes, perspective is a crucial element to consider. Simply put, perspective is the technique of creating the illusion of depth on a two-dimensional surface. Without it, drawings can appear flat and lack dimension.

### **What is Perspective?**

Perspective is the concept of creating the illusion of depth and distance on a flat surface. By using perspective techniques, artists can create the impression of space and depth in their drawings. It helps the viewer to see how objects relate to each other in terms of distance, height, and depth.

### **One-Point, Two-Point, and Three-Point Perspective**

There are several types of perspective techniques, but the most commonly used are one-point, two-point, and three-point perspective. One-point perspective is useful for drawing objects head-on, such as a cube. Two-point perspective is commonly used when drawing buildings or objects at an angle, such as a street or hallway. Three-point perspective is used for objects viewed from above or below, such as a bird's-eye view or worm's-eye view.

### **Tips for Achieving Correct Perspective in Drawings**

To achieve the correct perspective in your drawings, it's important to keep the following tips in mind:

1. Use a horizon line: A horizon line is an imaginary line that represents the viewer's eye level. It's essential to establish a horizon line before beginning to draw in order to create the correct sense of space.
2. Use vanishing points: A vanishing point is the point at which parallel lines appear to converge. For one-point perspective, there is only one vanishing point, while for two-point perspective, there are two. For three-point perspective, there are three vanishing points.
3. Understand foreshortening: Foreshortening is the technique of making an object appear shorter than it actually is due to the angle from which it is viewed. It's essential to understand foreshortening to create realistic-looking drawings.

By mastering the techniques of perspective drawing, you can take your artwork to the next level, creating realistic and visually engaging drawings.

## 4. Composition

Composition is the arrangement of visual elements in a drawing to create a visually pleasing and balanced image. It's the foundation of a successful drawing, and a well-composed image can draw the viewer's eye and hold their attention. Here are some essential elements of composition that every beginner should know.

### **Importance of Composition**

A well-composed drawing can make the difference between an amateur-looking piece of work and a professional-looking masterpiece. Composition can create a mood or feeling, convey a message, or simply draw the viewer's eye to a focal point. By understanding the basic principles of composition, you can create visually engaging and dynamic drawings.

### **Elements of Composition**

### Balance

Balance refers to the visual weight of the elements in a drawing. A balanced drawing feels stable and harmonious. There are two types of balance: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance is when elements are mirrored on either side of an imaginary central axis, while asymmetrical balance is achieved through the careful placement of elements of different sizes and shapes.

### Contrast

Contrast is the degree of difference between light and dark, or between different colors or textures. Contrast adds visual interest and can help draw the viewer's eye to a focal point. By varying the levels of contrast in your drawing, you can create depth and texture.

### Focal Point

The focal point is the area of a drawing that draws the viewer's attention. It's the element that stands out the most and is usually the most detailed or colorful. A well-placed focal point can draw the viewer's eye and create a sense of depth and dimension in the drawing.

### **Tips for Creating Effective Compositions**

- Consider the rule of thirds: Divide your drawing into thirds both horizontally and vertically and place your focal point at one of the points where the lines intersect. This creates a balanced and visually interesting composition.
- Use negative space: Negative space is the area around and between the subject(s) in your drawing. By paying attention to negative space, you can create interesting and dynamic compositions.
- Play with scale and perspective: Varying the size and placement of objects in your drawing can create a sense of depth and dimension, making your drawing more engaging and visually interesting.

By understanding the basics of composition, you can create visually pleasing and engaging drawings that will impress your audience.


## **VI. Value**

Value is the range of lightness and darkness in a drawing, and it plays a crucial role in creating depth and contrast. Learning how to create value can help beginner artists achieve more realistic and visually striking drawings.

### **Definition of value**

Value refers to the darkness or lightness of a color or tone, and it can be used to create contrast and depth in a drawing. In essence, value is what makes a drawing look three-dimensional rather than flat.

### **Techniques for creating value**

There are several techniques that artists can use to create value in their drawings:

- Blending: This involves using a blending tool, such as a blending stump or a piece of paper, to smooth out the transition between tones.
- Layering: Layering involves building up layers of color or tone to create the desired value.
- Smudging: Smudging involves using a tool, such as a blending stump or a piece of paper, to blur or smudge the lines between tones.

### **Examples and step-by-step instructions**

To create value using blending, follow these steps:

1. Draw a series of parallel lines on a piece of paper.
2. Use a blending tool, such as a blending stump or a piece of paper, to smooth out the lines between the parallel lines.
3. Continue to blend until you achieve the desired level of value.

To create value using layering, follow these steps:

1. Choose a color or tone that you want to use for your drawing.
2. Apply a light layer of the color or tone to the paper.
3. Gradually build up layers of the color or tone to create the desired level of value.

To create value using smudging, follow these steps:

1. Draw a series of lines or shapes on a piece of paper.
2. Use a blending tool, such as a blending stump or a piece of paper, to blur or smudge the lines or shapes.
3. Continue to smudge until you achieve the desired level of value.
