If you're a beginner at drawing, you might feel frustrated by your lack of progress. Don't worry, you're not alone! Many adults struggle with drawing, especially when they're just starting. One of the main reasons for this is that beginners often make common mistakes that can hold them back.

In this blog post, we'll cover some of the most common drawing mistakes made by adult beginners, such as proportion, perspective, shading, over-reliance on outlines, lack of variation in line weight, lack of attention to detail, and poor composition. Understanding these mistakes and how to fix them can help you improve your skills more quickly and feel more confident in your abilities. So, let's dive in!


## 1. Proportion mistakes
Proportion is the relationship between different parts of a drawing. When the proportions are correct, the drawing looks balanced and realistic. It's important to understand proportion because if you get it wrong, your drawing can look strange or unrealistic.

### Common Mistakes Beginners Make With Proportion

One common proportion mistake beginners make is making body parts too small or large. For example, a beginner might draw a person with a tiny head and oversized body, or vice versa. This can make the drawing look cartoonish or distorted.

Another mistake is not paying attention to the proportions of smaller details, such as facial features or limbs. If these are out of proportion, it can throw off the balance of the entire drawing.

### Tips and techniques for fixing proportion mistakes

To fix proportion mistakes, you can use reference images as a guide. Look at photos or other drawings and pay attention to the relationship between different parts of the subject. You can also practice with basic shapes to get a better sense of proportion. For example, draw a circle for the head and then add the body and limbs, making sure they are proportional to the head.

Remember, getting the proportions right takes practice and patience, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't come easily at first. Keep practicing and experimenting, and you'll soon see improvement in your drawings.

## 2. Perspective Mistakes
Perspective is the technique used to create the illusion of depth and space in a drawing. It's important because it can make a drawing look more realistic and believable. Without perspective, a drawing can look flat and two-dimensional.

### Common mistakes beginners make with perspective
One common mistake beginners make with perspective is making objects appear flat or distorted. For example, a beginner might draw a building with all the lines parallel, making it look like a cardboard cutout instead of a three-dimensional structure.

Another mistake is not understanding how lines converge, causing objects to look like they're floating or disconnected from the rest of the drawing.

### Tips and techniques for fixing perspective mistakes
To fix perspective mistakes, you can use a vanishing point to create the illusion of depth and space. This is the point on the horizon line where all lines appear to converge. You can also practice drawing objects from different angles and paying attention to how lines converge in real life.

Understanding the principles of one-point and two-point perspective can also be helpful in creating more realistic drawings. These techniques involve drawing objects as they appear in relation to the viewer's position and the horizon line.

Remember, perspective can take some time and practice to master, but with patience and persistence, you can improve your skills and create more dynamic and realistic drawings.

## 3. Shading mistakes
Shading is the technique used to create the illusion of depth, volume, and texture in a drawing. It's important because it can make a drawing look more three-dimensional and realistic. Shading can also help to create contrast and emphasize certain parts of a drawing.

### Common mistakes beginners make with shading
One common mistake beginners make with shading is using inconsistent values. This means that they may shade too dark in some areas and too light in others, resulting in a drawing that looks flat and disjointed. Another mistake is not understanding light sources, which can cause shadows and highlights to appear in the wrong places.

### Tips and techniques for fixing shading mistakes
To fix shading mistakes, you can practice with different shading techniques, such as hatching, cross-hatching, and stippling. It's also important to observe real-life lighting situations and how light interacts with objects. This can help you to understand where shadows and highlights should appear in your drawing.

Using a value scale can also be helpful in creating consistent values and avoiding mistakes with shading. A value scale is a series of squares or rectangles that gradually get lighter or darker, which can help you to determine the right amount of shading for different parts of your drawing.

Remember, shading can take some time and practice to master, but with dedication and attention to detail, you can improve your skills and create more realistic and dynamic drawings.

## V. Over-reliance on Outlines
Outlines are a crucial part of drawing, but relying too much on them can actually hinder your progress. When you rely too much on outlines, your drawings can end up looking stiff and flat, lacking depth and dimension.

### Common Outline Mistakes
Common mistakes beginners make with outlines include making them too heavy or dark, which can make the drawing appear muddy and unclear.

Another mistake is not knowing where to place outlines, resulting in a drawing that lacks definition and shape.

### Tips and techniques for fixing Outline Mistakes
To move beyond outlines, consider using gesture drawing. Gesture drawing involves quickly sketching the basic shapes and forms of the subject, focusing on capturing its essence rather than its details. This can help loosen up your drawings and give them more energy and movement.

Focusing on negative space is another technique to move beyond outlines. Negative space refers to the areas around and between objects. By focusing on the negative space, you can create more natural and accurate proportions, as well as add depth and dimension to your drawings.

Remember, outlines are just one tool in your drawing arsenal. Don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques and find what works best for you.

## VII. Lack of attention to detail
When it comes to drawing, details can make a huge difference in the overall quality of the work. Paying attention to small details can make a drawing look more realistic and compelling. Unfortunately, many beginner artists often overlook the importance of details and focus solely on the bigger picture.

### Common Detail Mistakes
One common mistake beginners make with details is not adding texture. For example, drawing a tree without adding texture to the leaves can make it look two-dimensional and uninteresting.

Another mistake is leaving out small features, such as freckles or wrinkles, that can add character and depth to a portrait.

### Tips and techniques for fixing Detail Mistakes
To improve attention to detail, it's important to start by observing the subject carefully and identifying the small details that make it unique. Using reference images can be helpful in understanding how details work in real life. Additionally, practicing observational drawing can train the eye to notice even the smallest details.

Adding texture can also be achieved by using different techniques like cross-hatching, stippling, or even just varying the pressure of the pencil. With practice and patience, paying attention to details can become second nature and greatly enhance the quality of an artist's work.

## Poor composition
Effective composition is essential in creating a successful drawing. Composition refers to the placement and arrangement of the elements in a drawing, which affects the overall feel and message of the piece.

Beginners often make the mistake of placing their subjects directly in the center of the page or not considering the surrounding negative space. This can result in a flat and uninteresting image.

To improve composition, try experimenting with different arrangements of elements and using the rule of thirds. This involves dividing the page into thirds both horizontally and vertically, and placing the subject at the intersection of those lines. It can create a more dynamic and visually appealing composition.

Additionally, consider the use of lines and shapes to guide the viewer's eye through the drawing and create a sense of movement. By paying attention to composition, beginners can take their drawings to the next level and create more engaging and impactful works.

## Key Take Away
Drawing is a skill that takes time and practice to master.

While it's easy to get discouraged by mistakes, it's important to remember that every artist goes through the same learning process. By recognizing and addressing common mistakes, beginners can improve their drawing skills and create more compelling artwork.

So don't give up! Keep practicing and experimenting. And most importantly, enjoy the process of learning and growing as an artist.
